            <p><strong>Role:</strong> Product Marketer (Seasonal, On-site)</p>
            <p>
                During my time promoting the newly opened Absolutely Perfect Water franchise, I took a proactive approach by visiting local stores to personally introduce our brand and explain the value of our supply chain.
                Through direct engagement and relationship building, I successfully increased brand awareness and boosted sales.
                Within just three weeks, we experienced a significant rise in demand, with several products selling out each week.
                This hands-on strategy not only strengthened our market presence but also contributed meaningfully to the franchise's early growth.

            <h2>AlgoTrade – Voluntary Work (Apr 2025 – Present)</h2>
            <p>
                This project is a C#-based algorithmic trading strategy implementation designed to execute buy trades on financial instruments with robust risk management features including stop loss and take profit orders.
                Built as part of a modular trading bot framework, the strategy connects to MetaTrader 5 and utilizes real-time market data to dynamically enter and manage buy positions, ensuring only one trade is open at a time to reduce exposure and optimize returns.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Key Features:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Focused buy-side trading strategy that opens one trade at a time per instrument</li>
                <li>Configurable stop loss and take profit levels based on pip distances for disciplined risk control</li>
                <li>Integration with MetaTrader 5 API for trade execution, modification, and position management</li>
                <li>Real-time market quote fetching for precise price calculations</li>
                <li>Automated trade lifecycle management including entry, exit, and position adjustment</li>
                <li>Support for trailing stop loss to lock in profits during favorable market moves</li>
                <li>Logging and error handling to ensure reliability and traceability</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Technologies:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>C# and .NET for core logic and service orchestration</li>
                <li>MetaTrader 5 API for trade execution</li>
                <li>Dependency injection for service management and configuration</li>
                <li>Asynchronous programming with async/await for responsive operations</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Use Case:</strong></p>
            <p>
                This strategy is ideal for traders and developers looking to automate conservative buy-side trading with built-in risk management on currency pairs or other financial instruments.
                It serves as a foundation for further customization or integration into larger algorithmic trading systems.
